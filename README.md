# RockPaperScissors_Game
I developed this Rock, Paper and Scissors game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This uses all the basic to advanced concepts of all of them. HTML is used to provide the structure to the game by adding various elements used in it. CSS is used to provide styling to the game to make it look more immersive and impressive. And finally JavaScript is used to add the functionality to Html elements and make the game responsive.

When the user selects one move among the 3 moves present, the computer randomly generated and choose a move out of those 3 moves. And finally either the you(user) or the computer wins.
